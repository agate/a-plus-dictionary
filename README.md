based on Google Dictionary (by Google)

## Why Plus

1. It was not good looking enough.
2. I would like it to show the meaning in both my language and English.

BTW, I am not sure it's legal or not (to modify their extension without informing them), but I think it won't be a big deal doing so... (And I guess you know I speak Chinese now,,, lol.)
